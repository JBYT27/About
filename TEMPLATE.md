Since then, I have pushed **{{ COMMITS }}** commits, opened **{{ ISSUES }}** issues, submitted **{{ PULL_REQUESTS }}** pull requests, received **{{ STARS }}** stars across **{{ REPOSITORIES }}** personal projects and contributed to **{{ REPOSITORIES_CONTRIBUTED_TO }}** public repositories.

I'm also planning on learning Expressjs and tinkering with Nodejs.
